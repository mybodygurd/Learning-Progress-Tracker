**Learning Progress Tracker**

**Description**

The Learning Progress Tracker is a command-line application written in Python that allows instructors to manage student records, track their progress across multiple courses, compute statistics, and send completion notifications. It supports the following courses:

* **Python** (600 points)
* **DSA** (Data Structures and Algorithms, 400 points)
* **Databases** (480 points)
* **Flask** (550 points)

**Features**

1. **Add Students**: Register students with unique email addresses and automatically assigned IDs.
2. **List Students**: Display all registered student IDs in the order they were added.
3. **Add Points**: Update student progress by adding points for each course.
4. **Find Student**: View total points per course for an individual student.
5. **Statistics**: Compute and display:

   * Most and least popular courses (by enrollment)
   * Highest and lowest activity courses (by number of submissions)
   * Easiest and hardest courses (by average points per submission)
   * Detailed course standings (sorted by points and ID)
6. **Notify**: Send a one-time congratulatory message to students who completed a course.
7. **Exit**: Gracefully terminate the application.
